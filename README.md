# [:bulb:] Why?

<p align="justify">CondoShare was conceived by the idea of a fictitious product used in my Systems Architecture classes in the Systems Analysis and Development college, in conjunction with my need to practice conventional and atomic commits. I used the content of a NodeJS course to give life to a system that promises to be the condominium dwellers' best ally when their need is to use uncommom tools for home tasks, which are shared by other friendly dwellers.</p>
